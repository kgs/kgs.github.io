{% img portrait /images/me.png That's me! %}

Hello, my name is Kamil Gorlo and I'm software engineer living in Warsaw, Poland.

Programming started to be my interest in early high school and since then (almost 15 years!) it not only became my hobby but also work. I create software professionally since 2006, currently working mainly with JVM technologies (like Java, Groovy, etc.) and backend systems (also distributed). I am mostly interested in high-performance and scalable architectures, [reactive][reactive_manifesto] applications and clean code. Recently I am also fascinated with machine learning, especially recommender systems.

When I am not in front of computer, I like to drive go-karts or do some other sports. Karting is definitely my biggest non-computer passion and I am really proud of my achievements in this field (like 3rd place in Polish Indoor Kart Championship 2014).

On this blog I'll try to write about my day-to-day adventures in software engineering. From time to time there will be probably also some 'soft' post, but of course I am not sure in which direction things will go. Let's hope everybody will find something interesting here ;)

If you want to contact me, the best way is to write an email (kgorlo@gmail.com). You can also learn about my professional career on [LinkedIn][linkedin], follow me on [Twitter][twitter] or look at my code on [GitHub][github].

Cheers!
