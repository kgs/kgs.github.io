Hello, my name is Kamil Gorlo and I'm software engineer living in Warsaw, Poland.

Programming started to be my interest in early high school and since then (almost 15 years!) it not only became my hobby but also work. I create software professionally since 2006, currently working mainly with JVM technologies (like Java, Scala, Groovy, etc.), backend systems (also distributed) and Hadoop ecosystem. I am mostly interested in high-performance and scalable architectures, [reactive][reactive_manifesto] applications and clean code. Recently I am also fascinated with data analysis and machine learning.

When I am not in front of computer, I like to drive go-karts or do some other sports. Karting is definitely my biggest non-computer passion and I am really proud of my achievements in this field (like 3rd place in Polish Indoor Kart Championship 2014).

If you want to contact me, the best way is to write an email (kgorlo@gmail.com). You can also learn about my professional career on [LinkedIn][linkedin], follow me on [Twitter][twitter] or look at my code on [GitHub][github].

Cheers!
