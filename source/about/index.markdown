Hello, my name is Kamil Gorlo and I'm software engineer living in Warsaw, Poland.

Programming started to be my interest in early high school and since then it not only became my hobby but also work. I create software professionally since 2006, working with variety of different technologies and programming languages (C/C++, Java, Scala, Go, Python and much more). I am mostly interested in high-performance, scalable architectures and data analysis. Occasionaly, I enjoy working close to hardware, digging into operating system internals!

When I am not in front of computer, I like to drive go-karts or do some other sports. Karting is definitely my biggest non-computer passion and I am really proud of my achievements in this field (like 3rd place in Polish Indoor Kart Championship 2014).

If you want to contact me, the best way is to write an email (kgorlo@gmail.com). You can also learn about my professional career on [LinkedIn][linkedin], follow me on [Twitter][twitter] or look at my code on [GitHub][github].

Cheers!
